In this design project, the complex problem of Gland Segmentation on the dataset provided by Warwick University is analysed and results are evaluated. Gland Segmentation is a vital step in diagnosis of adenocarcinoma (prevalent form of cancer that grows in the form of glands). For cancerous images gland segmentation becomes even more difficult as the glands lose their boundaries.

1.Segmentation algorithm in Python to extract the boundary of benign and malignant images.

2.Compute parameters of sensitivity, Specificity and Accuracy to evaluate your algorithm on test datasets.

3.Additional credit will be given to students whose evaluation parameters exceeds 80% on malignant images.

4.Use ML algorithm to identify whether the image is benign or malignant.



Extracted features from the images, trained ML classifier models and run prediction on them.

The classifier that we are going to use are K-NN Classifier, Naïve Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier.
