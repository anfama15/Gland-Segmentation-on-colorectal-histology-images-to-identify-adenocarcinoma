In this design project, the complex problem of Gland Segmentation on the dataset provided by Warwick University is analysed and results are evaluated. Gland Segmentation is a vital step in diagnosis of adenocarcinoma (prevalent form of cancer that grows in the form of glands). For cancerous images gland segmentation becomes even more difficult as the glands lose their boundaries.

1.Segmentation algorithm in Python to extract the boundary of benign and malignant images.

2.Computed parameters of sensitivity, Specificity and Accuracy to evaluate algorithms on test datasets.

3.Used ML algorithm to identify whether the image is benign or malignant.



Extracted features from the images, trained ML classifier models and run prediction on them.

The classifier that are used are K-NN Classifier, Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier.
